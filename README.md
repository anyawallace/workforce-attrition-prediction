# Workforce Attrition Prediction

## Problem
Organizations struggle to anticipate employee attrition, which leads to
staffing gaps, increased costs, and reduced readiness.

This project builds a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of employee
attrition using publicly available workforce data.

## Data
- Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset (public)
- Records: ~1,400 employees
- Features include age, role, income, tenure, performance, and satisfaction

## Approach
1. Cleaned and prepared raw data
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Engineered features relevant to attrition risk
4. Trained and evaluated classification models

## Results
- Identified key drivers of attrition
- Achieved strong baseline performance with interpretable models

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Files
- `notebooks/` – Analysis and modeling notebooks
- `data/` – Dataset (or link to source)
